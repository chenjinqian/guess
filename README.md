README

This is a small game I use to play with my friends. It goes this way, first he chose four number(no repeat) and write down that on a paper. Then I have 10 times to guess the answer. Every time, he will tell me only how much is right with amount and position(A ), and how much is right with amount, yet not fit the position(B ). For example, if he write (1 2 3 4), and first time I guess (1 2 4 5), then I get (A2, B1). I can record every result, and less time I try, better I won.
One day I want to play this game, but no one is aside. So I write this programe. Intersting thing is that, since then we play together against the computer. There is a record here too, we had fun that time.

TODO
I want to make this game cooperate with emacs, so I don't  have to envalue the funciton everytime and record by hand(though I can do some thing to make it faster, but still not the best way).

Any advice, please contact me.
